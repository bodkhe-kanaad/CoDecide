# CoDecide

## The smarter way to find common ground

**CoDecide** is a Java based local decision-making tool that allows users to submit their prefrences anonymouslys.Once all the users have submitted their prefrences **CoDecide** computes an aggregated result that reflects collective prioritization — not just a majority vote. Helping the group reach an agreement without the usual chaos in groupchats. **Designed to reduce bias, deadlocks, confusion and decision fatigue.**

### Why is **CoDecide** Unique ?

- **Anonymity-First** Design - *no bias due to peer visiblity.*
- **Supports complex decision dynamics** - *beyond the usual yes/no.*
- **Uses ranked aggregration** - *no more basic linear voting.*

The app is perfect for groups like roomates, friends, or project teammates who wish to have a low conflict and minimal confrontation to reach a consensus.

**CoDecide** comes from a problem we all run into very frequentlyt: trying to make decisions in a group, and getting nowhere. Whether it's choosing a place to eat, setting a meeting time, or planning an event, the group chat always turns into a mess — people stay silent, others dominate, and nothing actually gets decided. When I came across the paper **"Making Better Decisions in Groups by Bang and Frith"***(1)*, it clicked. The authors talk about how group decisions can actually be better than individual ones — but only if you remove social pressure and give people space to think on their own. That idea stuck with me.
This project is my way of putting that insight into action. CoDecide lets people quietly submit their preferences, then finds a fair group result without anyone having to argue or feel awkward. I wanted to build something simple, useful, and grounded in actual research.
